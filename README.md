# simplity

ridiculously simple set of APIs/framework for typical transaction processing systems .

simplity is based on the concepts used in Exility(https://github.com/ExilantTechnologies/ExilityCore-5.0.0).
It is re-designed based on the current best practices in the industry, and a complete re-write.
