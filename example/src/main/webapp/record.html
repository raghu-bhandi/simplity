		<h2>Record</h2>
		<p>Table, entity and data-structure are the other possible names
			for this component. Essentially we define a group of fields into a
			record and use it for different purposes. A record helps us in
			implementing one of the golden rules of design : DRY (Do not Repeat
			Yourself) Once a record is defined, we can use to represent a
			database table/view, or a data structure for a parameter for a stored
			procedure, or set of fields that are expected as input from client
			etc. We have three types of records:
		<ul>
			<li>Storage: represents a record that is stored as part of your
				data base. A storage record maps directly to a table in your RDBMS.
				Note that only storage records can be used for writing to the data
				base. (add/modify/delete)</li>
			<li>View: represents a record as seen by end-users. Typically a
				view has either a subset of fields from a storage record, or it is
				formed by picking fields from a set of related storage records. For
				example when you show details of a customer on a page, you may want
				to show total order value of this customer, number of pending orders
				etc.</li>
			<li>Structure: this is a set of related fields that are utilized
				by some part of your application, but they are not directly mapped
				to any field in a storage record. These fields are temporary data
				elements that are calculated at run time implement some business
				rules.</li>
		</ul>
