					provides three default classes. HelperForNoLogin during development
					if session variables are not used, DefaultHelper that uses a simple
					session management, and PassiveHelper when this application uses
					Simplity only as a module, and session is not managed by Simplity.
					You may write your session manager based on the application design</td>
